(consider changing   continue -> next  and  tie -> continue   (to mirror similar ideas in C loops))

Separate file name specifiers:

%O = overread-file   ?!
%P = push-file
%Q = pop-file

Ignoring elements:

%-  = ignore
%+  = consume

(ignore and consume can only be followed by: multiline [type], tie (continue), continue (next), end, overread-file, push-file, pop-file and general)

%-G = ignore general
%+G = consume general
